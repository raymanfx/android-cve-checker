Subject: mm, thp: Do not make page table dirty unconditionally in
 touch_p[mu]d()

commit a8f97366452ed491d13cf1e44241bc0b5740b1f0 upstream.

Currently, we unconditionally make page table dirty in touch_pmd().
It may result in false-positive can_follow_write_pmd().

We may avoid the situation, if we would only make the page table entry
dirty if caller asks for write access -- FOLL_WRITE.

The patch also changes touch_pud() in the same way.
