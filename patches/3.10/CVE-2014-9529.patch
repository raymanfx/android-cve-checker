Subject: [PATCH] KEYS: close race between key lookup and freeing

commit a3a8784454692dd72e5d5d34dcdab17b4420e74c upstream.

When a key is being garbage collected, it's key->user would get put before
the ->destroy() callback is called, where the key is removed from it's
respective tracking structures.

This leaves a key hanging in a semi-invalid state which leaves a window open
for a different task to try an access key->user. An example is
find_keyring_by_name() which would dereference key->user for a key that is
in the process of being garbage collected (where key->user was freed but
->destroy() wasn't called yet - so it's still present in the linked list).

This would cause either a panic, or corrupt memory.

Fixes CVE-2014-9529.
