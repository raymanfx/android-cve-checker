Subject: [PATCH] KEYS: Disallow keyrings beginning with '.' to be joined as session keyrings

commit ee8f844e3c5a73b999edf733df1c529d6503ec2f upstream.

This fixes CVE-2016-9604.

Keyrings whose name begin with a '.' are special internal keyrings and so
userspace isn't allowed to create keyrings by this name to prevent
shadowing.  However, the patch that added the guard didn't fix
KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING.  Not only can that create dot-named keyrings,
it can also subscribe to them as a session keyring if they grant SEARCH
permission to the user.

This, for example, allows a root process to set .builtin_trusted_keys as
its session keyring, at which point it has full access because now the
possessor permissions are added.  This permits root to add extra public
keys, thereby bypassing module verification.

This also affects kexec and IMA.

This can be tested by (as root):

	keyctl session .builtin_trusted_keys
	keyctl add user a a @s
	keyctl list @s

which on my test box gives me:

	2 keys in keyring:
	180010936: ---lswrv     0     0 asymmetric: Build time autogenerated kernel key: ae3d4a31b82daa8e1a75b49dc2bba949fd992a05
	801382539: --alswrv     0     0 user: a

Fix this by rejecting names beginning with a '.' in the keyctl.
