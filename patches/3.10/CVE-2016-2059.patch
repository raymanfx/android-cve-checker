Subject: [PATCH] net: ipc_router: Bind only a client port as control port

IPC Router binds any port as a control port and moves it from the client
port list to control port list. Misbehaving clients can exploit this
incorrect behavior.

IPC Router to check if the port is a client port before binding it as a
control port.
