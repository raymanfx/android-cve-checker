Subject: fs: fuse: Add replacment for CMA pages into the LRU cache

CMA pages are currently replaced in the FUSE file system since
FUSE may hold on to CMA pages for a long time, preventing migration.
The replacement page is added to the file cache but not the LRU
cache. This may prevent the page from being properly aged and dropped,
creating poor performance under tight memory condition. Fix this by
adding the new page to the LRU cache after creation.
